						<h1>Chatbots</h1>
					</header>

					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/chatbots.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>A chatbot is a program that can communicate in natural language with an individual. With the
						advent of artificial intelligence, these assistants are becoming more and more powerful and
						present in the digital landscape. I have developed several chatbots, using different
						technologies but also in different sectors.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Transport chatbot</h2>
					<p>The first chatbot I worked on was for a major railroad company during my internship at IBM. The
						project had already been running for several years and the goal of the internship was to take
						into account non-station addresses in the chatbot. This was done using APIs. This experience was
						my first contact with AI, indeed the chatbots were developed via IBM Watson, a platform allowing
						access to several AI services. One of the key concepts that I also retained and that I used
						later is that the intelligence of a chatbot does not only depend on its conversational capacity
						but also on the external knowledge it has.</p>

					<h2>Medical chatbot</h2>
					<p>The rapid development of new technologies has created a rupture, especially with people with
						chronic pathologies that require extensive monitoring or the elderly. Chatbots try to answer
						several problems concerning these people, such as personalized medical follow-up, communication
						and transmission of test results, information dissemination, or even advice or pre-diagnosis.
						Their main advantage is to present an interface allowing intuitive interactions, imitating human
						behavior.</p>
					<h3>Adapting your diet to your health</h3>
					<span class="image small"><img src="../images/food.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					<ul>
						<li>Taking certain medications requires following a very specific diet in parallel</li>
						<li>We have therefore developed a chatbot to which we communicate medical prescriptions and
							which will then suggest daily foods containing the nutritional contributions that will allow
							for better treatment results</li>
						<li>This chatbot is developed under Rasa, a framework for developing chatbots under Python. Rasa
							allows for a chatbot based on response rules and good database management</li>
						<li>This chatbot searches two databases: one containing the recommended nutritional intake for a
							certain drug, and another allowing to convert these intakes into equivalent food</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Help for people with Alzheimer's disease</h3>
					<span class="image small"><img src="../images/alzheimer.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
					<ul>
						<li>People with Alzheimer's disease may forget to perform simple everyday actions</li>
						<li>There are different levels of severity of the disease, ranging from occasional forgetfulness
							to the disease making independent living nearly impossible</li>
						<li>The goal of this chatbot is therefore to accompany patients on a daily basis by reminding
							them of everyday tasks while taking into account the diagnosis of the severity of the
							disease</li>
						<li>This chatbot was developed via Dialogflow, a tool that integrates machine learning methods
							for understanding and was deployed on Facebook</li>
						<li>Thanks to the chatbot patients will be able to schedule reminders for their appointments,
							for example, as well as view videos explaining how to perform certain tasks</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Customer relations</h2>
					<p>The advantage of chatbots is that they provide a sense of closeness to the customer because you
						can communicate with them as if you were talking to a human, and above all they reduce the costs
						associated with calls to customer service advisors. To ensure an optimal customer experience,
						these conversational agents can access the customer's information in the same way as a customer
						service representative and are configured to ask the most relevant questions possible to enable
						problem resolution.</p>
					<p>For the past few years, telecom companies have been developing increasingly intelligent
						conversational agents, integrating both the knowledge provided by their designers and the
						customer information they have at their disposal, but also thanks to the understanding of
						natural language, which allows them to deliver relevant and accurate content. Until now, they
						have relied on external conversational agent development services such as those from IBM and
						SAP. However, with the increase in conversation volumes, the costs of these services are
						becoming problematic, especially since their performance in terms of both response time and
						relevance is starting to deteriorate. It became necessary to develop an internal NLP solution to
						replace all or part of the calls to external services.</p>

					<h3>Development of the machine learning model</h3>
					<p>I decided to use Bert's embedding since there is a pre-trained model for French comprehension:
						CamemBert. Indeed it is very expensive to train such a complex language model (110 millions
						parameters) from the basic model. This forced us to switch to the Python language in which
						CamemBert is implemented.</p>
					<span class="image small"><img src="../images/rnn.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>I then developed the evaluation functions. This step is essential in order not to obtain a biased
						algorithm for example. In addition, apart from the classical metrics such as accuracy, we
						compute the Matthews correlation coefficient which allows to measure the quality of the
						classification or the F1 score. The advantage of these indicators is that they are less
						sensitive to class imbalances than accuracy. In addition, we display confusion matrices in order
						to visualize which classes were misclassified.</p>
					<p>Since it is a 161*161 matrix it is rather complicated to read its content here, nevertheless we
						can clearly observe that the diagonal presents classification percentages much higher than the
						rest of the matrix which shows that the algorithm performs overall good predictions. We can also
						zoom in on the "small talk" to better understand what is going on.</p>
					<span class="image small"><img src="../images/confusion.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>First, we notice that all classes have detection accuracies higher than what was expected, i.e.
						72%. And in general, the results are on average better than those of SAP and IBM, so it is time
						to make the service available via an API.</p>

					<h3>Setting up the API and deployment</h3>
					<p>I chose to use Django REST Framework to develop this service. It is a Python framework
						(development environment) allowing to build web services exposing APIs.</p>
					<p>DRF allows both the management of HTTP calls but it also simplifies the management of the
						database because it integrates an ORM (object-relational mapping) to interface it, and
						facilitates the management of users and IPs authorized to call the service. This framework also
						integrates Swagger which allows to document and use the API in a simple way.</p>
					<span class="image small"><img src="../images/swagger.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>In order to obtain a solution that integrates perfectly with the back-end and that can be part of
						an advanced CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous development) process, I also deployed the
						solution on Red Hat Openshift, which is a particular implementation of Kubernetes.</p>
